# Pandas and NumPy Practice
This repository contains my practice notebooks for learning and experimenting with the Python libraries **Pandas** and **NumPy**. These libraries are essential for data manipulation, analysis, and numerical computations.

## Contents
- pandas_practice.ipynb : Covers basic operations in Pandas, including DataFrame creation, indexing, slicing, and data manipulation.
- numpy_practice.ipynb  : Demonstrates the fundamentals of NumPy, such as array creation, mathematical operations, and indexing.

## Prerequisites
- To run these notebooks on your local machine, you'll need to have the following :
- 
- **Python 3.7 or later** (I recommend using version 3.12 for the latest features and stability)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: You can easily install it by running `pip install notebook` in your terminal.
- **Pandas**: This is essential for data manipulation. Install it using `pip install pandas`.
- **NumPy**: You'll need this for numerical operations, and you can install it with `pip install numpy`.

Once you've got everything set up, you're good to go!
