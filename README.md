# Pandas and NumPy Practice
This repository contains my practice notebooks for learning and experimenting with the Python libraries **Pandas** and **NumPy**. These libraries are essential for data manipulation, analysis, and numerical computations.

## Contents
- `pandas_practice.ipynb`: Covers basic operations in Pandas, including DataFrame creation, indexing, slicing, and data manipulation.
- `numpy_practice.ipynb` : Demonstrates the fundamentals of NumPy, such as array creation, mathematical operations, and indexing.

## Prerequisites
To run these notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later (3.12)
- Jupyter Notebook (`pip install notebook`)
- Pandas (`pip install pandas`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
